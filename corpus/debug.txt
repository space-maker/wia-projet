Alice Lee is sister of Bob. Bob loves to train at gym. Jean is friend with Alice and she wants to go today with him.
My family is a rather small one, with only three people, my father, my mother and me. My father is a doctor. My mother is a middle-school teacher.
I am still a student. 
My mother is very gentle and soft while my father is a little bit hot-tempered. We love each other very much. 
Although sometimes we might become angry at one another, very soon we will forget the unpleasant things. We're a happy family, how about you?
Kevin works with Alice every weeks. He is brother of Alice. Alice prefers to play with puppets with his friend, Jessy.
